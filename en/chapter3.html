<p><em>The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding
precisely what to build.</em> ‚Äì Frederick Brooks</p>
</blockquote>
<p> This chapter begins with a presentation on the importance of
software requirements and their different types (Section 3.1). Next, we
characterize and present the activities that comprise what we call
Requirements Engineering (Section 3.2). The next four sections (Sections
3.3 to 3.6) present a variety of techniques and documents used in the
specification and validation of requirements. Section 3.3 focuses on
user stories which are the principal tools for defining requirements in
agile methods. Following that, Section 3.4 elaborates on use cases,
which are more detailed documents for expressing requirements. In
Section 3.5, we explore the concept of Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a
popular technique for validating requirements. To wrap up, Section 3.6
provides insights on A/B testing, a common practice for selecting the
requirements of software products.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction <a
href="#introduction" class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p> <strong>Requirements</strong> define what a system should do and the
constraints under which it should operate. <q>What a system should
do</q> or its functions fall under <strong>Functional
Requirements</strong>. On the other hand, the constraints part is
described by <strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong>.</p>
<p> To better illustrate the dichotomy between these two types of
requirements, let‚Äôs revisit the home-banking system example from Chapter
1. For such a system, the functional requirements include features like
reporting the balance and statement of an account, processing transfers
between accounts, executing bank slip payments, canceling debit cards,
among others. In contrast, the non-functional requirements are tied to
the quality attributes of the system, including performance,
availability, security, portability, privacy, memory and disk usage, and
more. Essentially, non-functional requirements refer to operational
constraints. For example, it is not enough for our home-banking system
to provide all the functionalities required by the bank. It also needs
to have 99.9% availability‚Äîwhich thus acts as a constraint on its
operation.</p>
<p> As Fredrick Brooks emphasizes in the opening quote of this chapter,
requirements specification is a critical stage in software development
processes. For example, it is pointless to have a system with the best
design, implemented in a modern programming language, using the best
development process, with high test coverage if it does not meet the
needs of the users. Problems in the specification of requirements also
have a high cost. The reason is that a major rework might be required
when we discover‚Äîafter the system is implemented and deployed‚Äîthat some
requirements were specified incorrectly or that important requirements
were not implemented. At worst, there is a risk of delivering a system
that will be rejected by users because it does not solve their
problems.</p>
<p>Functional requirements are frequently specified in natural language
(i.e., in English, for example). Conversely, non-functional requirements
are<br />
specified using metrics, as illustrated in the following table:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Non-Functional Requirement</strong></th>
<th><strong>Metric</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Transactions per second, response time, latency, throughput</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Space</td>
<td>Disk usage, RAM, cache usage</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Reliability</td>
<td>% of availability, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Robustness</td>
<td>Time to recover the system after a failure (MTTR); probability of
data loss after a failure</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Usability</td>
<td>User training time</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Portability</td>
<td>% of portable lines of code</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Using metrics for defining non-functional requirements avoid nebulous
specifications like <q>the system should be fast and have high
availability</q>. Instead, it is recommended to specify, for example,
that the system should ensure 99.99% availability and 99% of the
transactions conducted in any 5-minute window should have a maximum
response time of 1 second.</p>
<p> Some authors, such as Ian Sommerville (<a
href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2851535">link</a>), also
divide requirements into <strong>user requirements</strong> and
<strong>system requirements</strong>. User requirements are high-level,
non-technical, and usually written by users in natural language.
Conversely, system requirements are more technical, precise and defined
by developers. Often, a single user requirement expands into a set of
system requirements. As an example, in our banking system, a user
requirement like <q>the system should allow funds transfer to another
bank‚Äôs checking account via wire transfers</q> would result in system
requirements specifying the detailed protocol that should be used for
such transactions. Essentially, user requirements are closer to the
problem while system requirements lean towards the solution.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="requirements-engineering"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Requirements Engineering <a
href="#requirements-engineering" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p> <strong>Requirements Engineering</strong> refers to activities such
as the identification, analysis, specification, and maintenance of a
system‚Äôs requirements. The term engineering is used to emphasize that
these activities should be performed systematically throughout a
system‚Äôs lifecycle, using well-defined techniques whenever possible.</p>
<p> The process of identifying, discovering, and understanding a
system‚Äôs requirements is termed <strong>Requirements
Elicitation</strong>. Elicitation, in this context, implies drawing out
the main requirements of the system from discussions and interactions
with developers and its stakeholders.</p>
<p>We can use various techniques for requirements elicitation, including
conducting stakeholder interviews, issuing questionnaires, reviewing
organizational documents, organizing user workshops, creating
prototypes, and analyzing usage scenarios. Other techniques rely on
ethnographic studies. Ethnography, a term whose roots trace back to
Anthropology, refers to studying a culture in its natural environment
(<em>ethnos</em>, in Greek, means people or culture). For instance, to
study a newly discovered indigenous tribe in Amazon, an anthropologist
might move to the tribe‚Äôs location and spend months living amongst them
and understanding their habits, customs, language, etc. Similarly, in
the context of Requirements Engineering, ethnography is a technique for
requirements elicitation that recommends developers to integrate into
the work environment of the stakeholders and observe‚Äîtypically for
several days‚Äîhow they perform their tasks. Note that this observation is
silent, meaning that the developer should not interfere with or express
personal views about the observed tasks and events.</p>
<p>Once requirements are elicited, they should be (1) documented, (2)
validated, and (3) prioritized.</p>
<p>In Agile development, requirements are documented using <strong>user
stories</strong> as previously discussed in Chapter 2. However, in some
projects, a <strong>Requirements Specification Document</strong> might
be necessary. This document describes all requirements of the software
to be built‚Äîincluding functional and non-functional requirements‚Äî
normally in natural language. In the 90s, the <strong>IEEE 830
Standard</strong>, was proposed for writing such documents. This
standard was suggested within the context of Waterfall-based models,
which, as we studied in Chapter 2, has a separated phase for
requirements specification. The main sections of the IEEE 830 standard
are presented in the next figure.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/cap3/ieee-830-standard.svg" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Template of a requirement specification document following the IEEE 830 standard" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Template of a requirement specification
document following the IEEE 830 standard</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> After specification, requirements should be checked and validated to
ensure they are correct, precise, complete, consistent, and verifiable,
as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Requirement should be <strong>correct</strong>. For example, an
incorrect computation for the savings account returns in a banking
system could result in either bank or client losses.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements should be <strong>precise</strong> to avoid
ambiguity. In fact, ambiguity occurs more frequently than we‚Äôd like when
using natural language. For example, consider the following condition:
to be approved, a student needs to score 60 points during the semester
or score 60 points in the Special Exam and attend the classes regularly.
Observe that it admits two different interpretations. Firstly: (60
points during the semester or 60 points in the Special Exam) and attend
classes regularly. But it can also be interpreted as: 60 points during
the semester or (60 points in the Special Exam and regular attendance).
As shown, parentheses were used to remove ambiguity in the combination
of the <q>and</q> and <q>or</q> operations</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements should be <strong>complete</strong> to ensure all
necessary features, especially the most relevant ones, are considered
and are not forgotten.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements must be <strong>consistent</strong>. Inconsistency
arises when different stakeholders have distinct expectations‚Äîfor
example, if one stakeholder expects an availability of 99.9%, but
another believes 90% suffices.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements should be <strong>verifiable</strong>, implying we
can check their implementations. For example, just stating that a system
should be user-friendly is vague; how can developers verify if they‚Äôve
met the clients‚Äô expectations in this case?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, requirements must be prioritized. At times, the term
requirements is taken literally, i.e., as a list of mandatory features
and constraints in software systems. However, not everything specified
by clients will be implemented in the initial releases. For instance,
budget and time constraints might cause the delay of certain
requirements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, requirements can change, as the world changes. For
example, in the banking system mentioned earlier, the rules for savings
account returns should be updated every time they are changed by the
responsible federal agency. Thus, if a requirements specification
document exists, it should be updated, just like the source code. The
ability to identify the requirements implemented by a given piece of
code and vice versa (i.e., to map a particular requirement to the code
implementing it) is called <strong>traceability</strong>.</p>
<p>Before concluding, it‚Äôs important to mention that Requirements
Engineering is a multi-disciplinary activity. For instance, political
factors might motivate certain stakeholders to do not cooperate with
requirement elicitation, particularly when this will threaten their
status and power within the organization. Other stakeholders may simply
not have time to meet with developers to explain the system‚Äôs
requirements. Moreover, a cognitive barrier between stakeholders and
developers may also impact the elicitation of requirements. For example,
since stakeholders are typically seasoned experts, they might use a
specialized language, unfamiliar to developers.</p>
<p><strong>Real World Insight</strong>: To understand the challenges
faced in Requirements Engineering, in 2016, about two dozen researchers
organized a survey with 228 software-developing companies spread across
10 countries (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10288">link</a>). When
asked about the main problems faced in requirements specification, the
ten most common answers were as follows (including the percentage of
companies that cited each problem):</p>
<ul>
<li>Incomplete or undocumented requirements (48%)</li>
<li>Communication flaws between developers and customers (41%)</li>
<li>Constantly changing requirements (33%)</li>
<li>Abstractly specified requirements (33%)</li>
<li>Time constraints (32%)</li>
<li>Communication flaws among team members (27%)</li>
<li>Difficulty to distinguish requirements from solutions (25%)</li>
<li>Insufficient support by customers(20%)</li>
<li>Inconsistent requirements (19%)</li>
<li>Weak access to customers‚Äô or business information (18%)</li>
</ul>

aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p>The following figure summarizes our studies on requirements so far,
showing how requirements act as a bridge that links a real-world problem
with a software that solves. We will use this figure to motivate and
introduce the topics we will study for the rest of this chapter.</p>

</figure>
<p>First, the figure is useful for illustrating a common situation in
Requirements Engineering: systems whose requirements change frequently
or whose users cannot accurately specify what they want in the system.
In fact, we‚Äôve already studied such systems in Chapter 2, when we
discussed Agile Methods. As the reader may recall, when requirements
change frequently, and the system is a non-mission-critical one, it is
not recommended to invest years drafting a detailed requirements
document. There‚Äôs a risk the requirements become outdated before the
system is finalized‚Äîor a competitor can anticipate and build an
equivalent system and dominate the market. In such cases, as we also
commented in Chapter 2, we should use lightweight requirement
specification documents‚Äîsuch as <strong>user stories</strong>‚Äîand
incorporate a representative of the customers into the development team,
to clarify and explain the requirements to the developers. Given the
importance of such scenarios‚Äîsystems with constantly evolving, but
non-critical requirements‚Äìwe will start by studying user stories in
Section 3.3.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some systems have relatively stable requirements.
In these cases, it might be worth to invest in detailed requirement
specifications. Certain companies, for instance, prefer to document all
the system‚Äôs requirements before starting the development. Lastly,
requirements can be demanded by certification organizations, especially
for systems that deal with human lives, such as systems in the medical,
transportation, or military fields. In Section 3.4, we will study
<strong>use cases</strong>, which are comprehensive documents for
specifying requirements.</p>
<p>A third scenario arises when we do not know if the proposed
<q>problem</q> truly warrants a solution. That is, we might collect all
the requirements of this <q>problem</q> and implement a system that
solves it. However, the uncertainty remains whether the system will
succeed and attract users. In these scenarios, an interesting procedure
is to take a step back and first test the relevance of the problem we
intend to solve by software. A possible test involves building a
<strong>Minimal Viable Product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>). An MVP
is a functional system that can be used by real clients. However, it
only includes the features necessary to prove its market feasibility,
i.e, its ability to solve a problem faced by some clients. Given the
contemporary importance of such scenarios‚Äîsoftware for solving problems
in unknown or uncertain markets‚Äîwe will study more about MVPs in Section
3.5.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="user-stories"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> User Stories <a
href="#user-stories" class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p> Requirement documents, produced during waterfall development
processes, can amount to hundreds of pages that sometimes require more
than a year to complete. These documents often run into following
problems: (1) they may become obsolete as requirements change during
development; (2) descriptions in natural language tend to be ambiguous
and incomplete; thus developers have to go back and talk to the
customers during development to clarify doubts; (3) when these
conversations do not happen, the risks are even higher: at the end of
the implementation, customer mays conclude they do want the system
anymore, as their priorities changed, their vision of the business
changed, the internal processes of their company changed, and so on.
Therefore, a long initial phase of requirements specification is
increasingly rare, at least in the case of commercial systems, like
those being discussed in this book.</p>
<p>The industry professionals who proposed agile methods recognized‚Äîor
suffered from‚Äîsuch problems and proposed a pragmatic technique to solve
them, known as <strong>User Stories</strong>. As described by Ron
Jeffries in his book on Agile Development (<a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=557459">link</a>), a user story
constitutes three parts, termed the three Cs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User Story = Card + Conversations + Confirmation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, we explore each of these parts of a story:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Card</strong>, used by customers to write, in their
language and in a few sentences, a feature they hope to see implemented
in the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conversations</strong> between customers and developers,
facilitating understanding of what is detailed on each card. As stated
before, agile methods view on requirements is pragmatic: as textual
specifications of requirements are subjected to problems, they have been
eliminated and replaced by verbal communication between developers and
customers. Moreover, agile methods‚Äîas we already studied in Chapter
2‚Äîdefine that a representative of the customers, also known as Product
Owner or Product Manager should be part of the team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confirmation</strong>, which is essentially a high-level
test‚Äî specified by the customer‚Äîto verify whether the story was
implemented as expected. Therefore, it is not an automated test, like an
unit test, for example. But the description of scenarios, examples, and
test cases that the customer will use to confirm the implementation of
the story. These tests are also called <strong>acceptance
tests</strong>. They should be written as soon as possible, preferably
at the beginning of a sprint. Some authors recommend writing them on the
back of the user story cards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, requirement specifications via stories are not just
two or three sentences, as some critics of agile methods may claim. The
correct way to interpret a user story is as follows: the story written
on the card is a <q>reminder</q> from the customer‚Äôs representative to
the developers. By creating this <q>reminder</q>, the representative
declares they would like to see a certain feature implemented in the
next sprints. In addition, they agree to be available during the sprints
to refine the story, and explain it to the developers. Lastly, they also
will consider the story implemented as long as it meets the confirmation
tests they have also specified.</p>
<p>From a developer‚Äôs standpoint,, the process works like this: the
customer‚Äôs representative is asking us to implement the story summarized
on this card. Therefore, we will have to implement it in the next
sprint. However, we can count on the full support of the customer
representative to discuss and clarify any doubts about the story.
Additionally, the representative has already defined the tests they will
use at the sprint review meeting to consider the story implemented.
Finally, we further agree that the representative cannot change their
mind at the end of the sprint and use an entirely different test to
assess our implementation.</p>
<p>In essence, when employing user stories, requirements engineering
becomes a continuous activity occurring daily during development. The
traditional requirements document with hundreds of pages is replaced by
regular conversations between developers and the customer
representative. User stories emphasize verbal engagement over written
communication, thus aligning with the following principles of the Agile
Manifesto: (1) individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
(2) working software over comprehensive documentation; (3) customer
collaboration over contract negotiation; (4) responding to change over
following a plan.</p>
<p> User stories should have the following characteristics (whose
initials in English form the acronym INVEST):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stories must be <strong>independent</strong>: given two stories X
and Y, it should be possible to implement them in any order. Ideally,
there should no have dependencies between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Stories must be <strong>negotiable</strong>. As we mentioned
before, stories (the card) are invitations for conversations between
customers and developers during a sprint. Therefore, both parties should
be open to change and adapt their opinions as result of these
discussions. Developers should be open to implement details not
expressed or that do not fit on the story cards. Customers should accept
technical arguments from developers, for example about the complexity of
implementing some aspect of the story as initially planned.</p></li>
<li><p>Stories must add <strong>value</strong> to the customers‚Äô
business. Stories are proposed, written, and ranked by the customers
according to the value they add to their business. For this reason, the
idea of a technical story doesn‚Äôt exist, such as this one: <q>the system
has to be implemented in JavaScript, using React on the front-end and
Node.js on the backend</q>.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be possible to <strong>estimate</strong> the size of a
story, i.e., to define how many days will be necessary to implement it.
Normally, this requires the story to be small, which we will discuss
next, and for the developers to have experience in the system‚Äôs
domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Stories must be <strong>small</strong>. In fact, complex and
large stories‚Äîalso known as <strong>epics</strong>‚Äîcan exist but they
should be placed at the bottom of the backlog, meaning they will not be
implemented soon. On the contrary, stories at the top of the backlog
should be short and small to facilitate understanding and estimating
them. Assuming that a sprint has a maximum duration of one month, it
should be possible to implement such stories in less than one week, for
example.</p></li>
<li><p>Stories must be <strong>testable</strong>, that is, they should
have clear acceptance tests. For example, <q>the customer may pay with
credit cards</q> is testable, assuming we know the credit card brands
that can be used. On the other hand, the following story is a
counter-example: <q>a customer should not wait too long to have their
purchase confirmed.</q> This is a vague story and, therefore, it does
not have a clear acceptance criterion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also recommended to list the main users who will interact with
the system before starting to write stories in order to avoid stories
that only serve certain users. Once you have defined these <strong>user
roles</strong> (or <strong>personas</strong>), stories are commonly
written in the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a [user role], I want to [do something with the system]</p>
</blockquote>
<p> We will show examples of stories in this format in the next section.
But first, we would like to mention that a <strong>story writing
workshop</strong> is usually carried out at the inception of a software
project. This workshop gathers the the system‚Äôs main users in a room,
who then discuss the system‚Äôs objectives, its main features, and so on.
At the end of the workshop, which can last a week depending on the size
and relevance of the project, we should have a valuable list of user
stories for implementation over multiple sprints.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="example-library-management-system"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Example: Library Management
System <a href="#example-library-management-system" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p>In this section, we give examples of user stories for a library
management system. They are associated with three types of users:
typical users, professors, and library staff.</p>
<p>First, we show stories suggested by regular users (see below). Any
library user fits this role and therefore can perform the operations
described in these stories. Note that the stories are just a sentence
and do not elaborate on how each operation will be implemented. For
example, a story defines that users should search for books. However,
many details are omitted, including the search criteria, available
filters, limits on the number of search results, the layout of search
and results screens, etc. But we should remember that a story is
essentially a commitment: the customer representative assures that they
will be available to clarify these details in discussions with the
developers during the sprint in which the story will be implemented.
When working with user stories, this verbal interaction between
developers and the customer representative is key for successful
requirements specification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a regular user, I want to borrow books</p>
<p>As a regular user, I want to return a book I borrowed</p>
<p>As a regular user, I want to renew my book loans</p>
<p>As a regular user, I want to search for books</p>
<p>As a regular user, I want reserve borrowed books</p>
<p>As a regular user, I want to receive emails about new
acquisitions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, we show the stories suggested by professors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a professor, I want borrow books for an extended period of
time</p>
<p>As a professor, I want to recommend books for acquisition</p>
<p>As a professor, I want to donate books to the library</p>
<p>As a professor, I want to return books to other libraries</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Even though these stories originate from professor users, this
doesn‚Äôt mean they are exclusive for this user group. During the
sprint‚Äôs, the customer representative (or Product Owner) may consider
making the donation feature available to all users. The final story
proposed by professor‚Äîallowing books to be returned at any university
library‚Äîcan be classified as an <strong>epic</strong>, i.e., a complex
story. This story refer to a scenario where a professor borrows a book
from the main library but want to return it to the library of a given
department, or vice versa. Implementing this functionality is more
complex because it requires integrating different library systems and
having staff to transport the books back to their original location.</p>
<p>Lastly, we share the stories proposed by library staff, typically
concerning library organization and ensuring the library‚Äôs seamless
operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a staff member, I want to register new users</p>
<p>As a staff member, I want to add new books to the system</p>
<p>As a staff member, I want to discard damaged books</p>
<p>As a staff member, I want to access statistics about the
collection</p>
<p>As a staff member, I want the system to send reminder emails to
students with overdue books</p>
<p>As a staff member, I want the system to apply fines in the case of
late book returns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To confirm the implementation of this story, the customer
representative specified that they would like to successfully perform
the following searches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Search for books using the ISBN</p>
<p>Search for books using the author‚Äôs name, returning books whose
author matches the search string</p>

<p>The execution of these types of search will be demonstrated during

<p>Acceptance tests should be specified by the customer representative.
(or Product Owner). This practice prevents a scenario known as
<strong>gold plating</strong>. In Requirements Engineering, the
expression describes the situation where developers decide on their own
to elaborate some stories‚Äîor requirements, more generally‚Äîwithout the
customer‚Äôs input. In a literal translation, developers are embellishing
stories with layers of gold, when this won‚Äôt generate value for
users.</p>

<p>Before we wrap up, and as usual in this book, let‚Äôs answer some
questions about user stories:</p>
<p><strong>How do we specify non-functional requirements using
stories?</strong> This is a challenging issue when using agile methods.
Indeed, the customer representative (or Product Owner) may write a story
stating that <q>the system‚Äôs maximum response time should be 1
second.</q> However, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to allocate this story to a
given sprint as it should be a concern in each sprint of the project.
Therefore, the best solution is to allow (and ask) the PO to write
stories about non-functional requirements, but use them primarily to
reinforce the <q>done criteria</q> for stories. For example, for the
implementation of a story to be considered complete, it should pass a
code review aimed at detecting performance problems. Before the code
moves to production, a performance test can also be executed to ensure
that the non-functional requirements are being met. In short, one
can‚Äîand should‚Äî‚Äìwrite stories about non-functional requirements, but
they do not go into the product backlog. Instead, they are used to
refine the ‚Äúdone criteria for stories.</p>
