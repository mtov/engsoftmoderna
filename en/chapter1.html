<p><em>Our civilization runs on software.</em> ‚Äì Bjarne Stroustrup</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this initial chapter, we outline the objectives and challenges
tackled in Software Engineering (see Section 1.1). We additionally
provide an overview of the primary subjects investigated in this field
of Computer Science (see Section 1.2). Our goal is to provide a
comprehensive understanding of the field before diving into specific
issues and techniques. As Software Engineering is a broad domain, we
also discuss the types of software systems that can make use of the
principles and practices presented in this book (see Section 1.3). This
is done to avoid any misconceptions concerning the scope of our work. In
conclusion, we present the topics addressed in the remaining chapters of
the book (see Section 1.4).</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="definition-context-and-history"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Definition, Context, and
History <a href="#definition-context-and-history" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p>In today‚Äôs world, virtually everything operates via software. Various
organizations, including businesses of every scale and governmental
entities, depend on software systems to deliver their services
effectively. Governments often interact with citizens through software
applications like public service delivery platforms and tax collection
systems. Many businesses sell a wide range of products directly to
consumers via e-commerce platforms. Software is also in physical
products and devices including cars, airplanes, satellites, and robots.
Furthermore, software is revitalizing traditional industries and
services such as telecommunications, transportation in large urban
centers, and advertising.</p>
<p>Given the crucial role software plays in our society, it‚Äôs
unsurprising that a subfield of Computer Science focuses on finding
solutions for the development of software systems, particularly large
and complex ones. This subfield is known as <strong>Software
Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>Software Engineering is concerned with the systematic, disciplined,
and quantifiable approaches to develop, operate, maintain, and evolve
software systems. As mentioned, this field is central to Computer
Science and is engaged with applying engineering principles in software
construction.</p>
<p>Historically, Software Engineering as a field emerged in the late
1960s. During this period, the first generation of modern computers
began to be used for problem-solving. However, at that time, software
took a back seat, as the primary focus was building machines capable of
solving a limited set of scientific or mathematical problems.</p>
<p>However, advancements in hardware technologies changed this scenario.
By the end of the ‚Äô60s, computers had become more common, were present
in many universities, and businesses were beginning to reap the benefits
of their use. Consequently, a new set of challenges surfaced, as users
demanded more complex and diverse applications, including commercial
systems for tasks such as payroll, accounting, and inventory
management.</p>
<p> <strong>NATO Conference</strong>: In October 1968, around 50 eminent
Computer Scientists gathered for a week in Garmisch, Germany, for a
NATO-sponsored conference. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss a
<q>crucial problem of computer usage, the so-called software</q>. The
conference concluded with a 130-page report advocating the construction
of software based on practical and theoretical principles, similar to
other branches of engineering. In light of this proposition, the
participants coined the term Software Engineering, effectively
establishing this field in Computer Science. For this reason, the NATO
Conference is considered the historical genesis of the Software
Engineering research field.</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the participants of the NATO Conference summarized the
challenges faced by the newly created research field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic problem is that certain classes of systems are placing
demands on us which are beyond our capabilities and our theories and
methods of design and production at this time. There are many areas
where there is no such thing as a crisis‚Äîsort routines, payroll
applications, for example. It is large systems that are encountering
great difficulties. We should not expect the production of such systems
to be easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, more than half a century after the NATO Conference, techniques
and methods for software construction have improved remarkably. It‚Äôs now
widely recognized that software, in most instances, should not be built
in strictly sequential phases as happens with traditional engineering
products. Many patterns can assist software engineers in their work,
avoiding the need to <q>reinvent the wheel</q> for every new design
problem. Libraries and frameworks for various purposes are available,
allowing software developers to reuse code without delving into the
details of tasks such as implementing graphical interfaces, manipulating
data structures, accessing databases, and encrypting messages. A
multitude of testing techniques can‚Äîand should‚Äîbe deployed to ensure
that the produced code functions as expected when used by actual
customers. Like other engineering products, software systems also
deteriorate over time and therefore require maintenance, not only for
bug fixing but also to ensure their long-term maintainability and
comprehension.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="no-silver-bullet">No Silver Bullet <a
href="#no-silver-bullet" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Software development has inherent characteristics when compared to
other engineering products, especially hardware. Frederick Brooks, a
1999 Turing Award recipient and a pioneer in Software Engineering, was
among the first to underscore this uniqueness. In 1987, he wrote an
essay titled <em>No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accident in Software
Engineering</em> (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.1987.1663532">link</a>) where he
highlighted the peculiarities of Software Engineering.</p>
<p>According to Brooks, there are two types of challenges in software
engineering: <strong>essential difficulties</strong> and
<strong>accidental difficulties</strong>. Essential ones are intrinsic
to the field and are unlikely to be solved by any novel technology or
method.</p>
<p>The term <q>silver bullet</q>, as used in Brooks‚Äôs essay title,
refers to a magical solution to a complex problem. Brooks argued that
due to the innate challenges of Software Engineering, we should not
anticipate the existence of silver bullets in the field. Nonetheless,
many new software technologies are often marketed as if they were, in
fact, silver bullets.</p>
<p>Brooks described the following essential difficulties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: Of all human-made constructions,
software stands out as one of the most intricate and complex. Even
conventional engineering constructs, like satellites, nuclear power
plants, or rockets, are increasingly relying on software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conformity</strong>: Software must adapt continuously to
its ever-changing environment. For instance, changes in tax legislation
require prompt adaptations by all related software. This level of
adaptability is not required in other fields like Physics where natural
laws do not change due to human decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changeability</strong>: There is constant pressure for
software to evolve and incorporate new features. In fact, the more
successful a software system, the more it is likely to attract demands
for modifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invisibility</strong>: It is inherently challenging to
visualize the size and effort required to create software due to its
abstract nature.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Challenges (2), (3), and (4) are exclusive to software systems. They
do not exist in other engineering products, at least not with the same
intensity. When environmental laws change, car manufacturers have years
to comply with new legislation. Also, cars, once manufactured, do not
usually receive new functionalities. Furthermore, a car‚Äôs physical
properties, such as weight, height, width, seats, and geometric shape,
facilitate valuation by consumers.</p>
<p>Software development also faces accidental difficulties, which can
typically be solved by engineers given adequate training and access to
existing technologies and resources. Examples of such difficulties
include an IDE that frequently crashes, a compiler that produces cryptic
error messages, a framework missing documentation, or a web application
with a confusing interface.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Real World</strong>: The complexity involved in building
software systems can be illustrated by considering their scale. For
instance, as of 2017, the Linux operating system (version 4.1.3)
comprised about 25 million lines of code, which were produced by nearly
1,700 engineers (<a
href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/2017-linux-kernel-report-landing-page">link</a>).
Another example is Google‚Äôs applications which, as of January 2015,
contained over two billion lines of code, distributed across nine
million files (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2854146">link</a>). At
that time, Google‚Äôs software engineers submitted about 40,000 code
change requests per day on average.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="what-is-studied-in-software-engineering"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What is Studied in Software
Engineering? <a href="#what-is-studied-in-software-engineering"
class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p> To answer this question, we rely on the <em>Guide to the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge</em>, also known by the acronym SWEBOK (<a
href="http://www.swebok.org">link</a>). This report is organized by the
IEEE Computer Society (an international scientific society) with the
support of various researchers and industry professionals. The purpose
of the report is to document the body of knowledge that characterizes
the area that we call Software Engineering today.</p>
<p>The SWEBOK defines twelve knowledge areas in Software
Engineering:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Requirements Engineering</p></li>
<li><p>Software Design</p></li>
<li><p>Software Construction</p></li>
<li><p>Software Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Software Maintenance</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration Management</p></li>
<li><p>Project Management</p></li>
<li><p>Software Processes</p></li>
<li><p>Software Models</p></li>
<li><p>Software Quality</p></li>
<li><p>Professional Practice</p></li>
<li><p>Software Economics</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, the SWEBOK includes three other knowledge areas: Computing
Foundations, Mathematical Foundations, and Engineering Foundations.
However, as they are located in the frontier with other scientific
areas, they are not covered in this chapter.</p>
<p>In the rest of this section, we briefly comment on each of the areas
listed above. Our goal is to provide an overview of the knowledge
developed over the years in Software Engineering and, thus, inform the
reader about <em>what</em> is studied in this area.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="requirements-engineering"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Requirements Engineering <a
href="#requirements-engineering" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Requirements define <em>what</em> a system should do and <em>how</em>
it should operate. Thus, Requirements Engineering designates the
activities carried out to analyze, document, and validate a system‚Äôs
requirements. Requirements can be <strong>functional</strong> or
<strong>non-functional</strong>.</p>
<p> Functional requirements define <em>what</em> a system should do;
that is, which functionalities or services it should implement.
Non-functional requirements, on the other hand, define <em>how</em> a
system should operate, under which constraints, and with what quality of
service. Examples of non-functional requirements are performance,
availability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, interoperability,
capacity, maintainability, and usability.</p>
<p>For example, consider a banking application. In this case, the
functional requirements include providing account balance, showing the
statement, transferring values between accounts, canceling a debit card,
among others. Non-functional requirements, for example, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Performance: it must provide account balance in under two
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Availability: it must be online 99% of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Fault tolerance: it must continue operating even if a certain
data center fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Security: it must encrypt all data exchanged with
branches.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy: customer data should not be leaked to third
parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Interoperability: it must integrate with systems of the Central
Bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacity: it should be able to store and handle data for one
million banking customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Usability: it must have a version for visually impaired
people.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="software-design"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Software Design <a
href="#software-design" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> During design, the main code units of a software system are defined,
but only at the level of interfaces, including <strong>provided
interfaces</strong> and <strong>required interfaces</strong>. Provided
interfaces are those services that a code unit makes public for use by
the rest of the system. Required interfaces are those interfaces upon
which a code unit depends to operate.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the design of a software system, we do not get into
implementation details of each code unit, such as method implementation
details, in case the system is implemented in an object-oriented
language. For example, during the design of a banking system, we can
define a class to represent bank accounts, like the following one:</p>
<pre><code>class BankAccount {
   private Customer customer;
   private double balance;
   public double getBalance() { ... }
   public String getCustomerName() { ... }
   public String getStatement (Date start) { ... }
   ...
}</code></pre>
<p>First, it is important to note that the implementation above is quite
simple, as our goal is only to explain the difference between software
design and implementation. Thus, it is important to mention that
<code>BankAccount</code> offers an interface to the other system
classes, in the form of its public methods, which constitute the
interface provided by the class. But <code>BankAccount</code> also
depends on another class, <code>Customer</code>; thus, the
<code>Customer</code> interface is a required interface for
<code>BankAccount</code>. Often, required interfaces are called
dependencies. That is, <code>BankAccount</code> has a dependency on
<code>Customer</code>.</p>
<p> When the design is performed at a higher level and the code units
have a coarser granularity‚Äîthey are packages or folders, for example‚Äîit
is classified as an architectural design. In other words,
<strong>software architecture</strong> deals with the organization of a
system at a level of abstraction higher than th e one involving classes
or similar constructs.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3" id="software-construction"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Software Construction <a
href="#software-construction" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Construction deals with implementation, that is, coding the system.
At this point, there are many decisions that need to be made, such as
defining the algorithms and data structures to be used, defining the
third-party frameworks and libraries to be used; defining techniques for
exception handling; defining standards for names, layout, and code
documentation and, last but not least, defining the tools to be used in
development, including compilers, integrated development environments
(IDEs), debuggers, database managers, and tools for building
interfaces.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.4" id="software-testing"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Software Testing <a
href="#software-testing" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Testing involves executing a program with a finite set of cases and
verifying whether it produces the expected behavior. This quote from
Edsger W. Dijkstra‚Äîwho also won the Turing Award in Computing
(1982)‚Äîsummarizes the benefits of testing, but also its limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their
absence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that least three points should be discussed about testing in
this first chapter of our book. First, there are many types of tests.
For example, <strong>unit tests</strong> (when we test a small unit of
code, such as a class), <strong>integration tests</strong> (when we test
a larger unit, such as a set of classes), <strong>performance
tests</strong> (when we submit the system to a given load to check its
performance), and <strong>usability tests</strong> (when we aim to check
the usability of the system‚Äôs user interface).</p>
<p>Second, tests can be used both for verification and for validation.
Verification aims to ensure that a system complies with its
specification. With validation, the objective is to ensure that the
system meets the customers‚Äô needs. The difference between the concepts
only exists because a system‚Äôs specification might not attend the needs
of its customers. This mismatch can be caused by an error in the
requirements specification phase. For example, developers might have not
understood the requirements or the client might have not explained them
precisely.</p>
<p>Two sentences are often used to synthesize the differences between
verification and validation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verification</strong>: Are we implementing the system
correctly? That is, in accordance with its requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validation</strong>: Are we implementing the correct
system? That is, the one the customers or the market demands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when we run a method to check whether it returns the specified
results, we are performing a verification activity. On the other hand,
when we perform a acceptance meeting with clients, presenting them the
system results and features, we are conducting a validation
activity.</p>
<p> Third, it is also important to define and distinguish three terms
related to tests: <strong>defects</strong>, <strong>bugs</strong>, and
<strong>failures</strong>. To illustrate the difference between them,
consider the following code that calculates the area of a circle,
depending on a certain condition:</p>
<pre><code> if (condition)
    area = pi * radius * radius * radius; </code></pre>
<p>This code has a defect because the area of a circle is <q>pi times
radius squared</q>, not cubed. Bug is a more informal term, used with
different purposes. But the most common one is as a synonym for defects.
Finally, a failure occurs when a defective code is executed ‚Äî for
example, when the <code>if</code> condition above evaluates to true ‚Äî
and, as a result, causes the program to show an incorrect result.
Therefore, not every defect or bug leads to failures, since the
defective code may never be executed.</p>
<p>In summary: defective (or a buggy) code is a code that does not
comply with its specification. If this code is executed and actually
causes the program to produce an incorrect output, we say that a failure
has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>In-Depth:</strong> In the literature on testing, the terms
<strong>error</strong> and <strong>fault</strong> are sometimes
mentioned. When this happens, the meaning is the same as we adopt for
<em>defect</em> before. For example, the <em>IEEE Standard Glossary of
Software Engineering Terminology</em> (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1990.101064">link</a>) defines a
fault as an <q>incorrect step, process, or data definition in a computer
program; the terms error and bug are [also] used to express this
meaning</q>. In summary, <em>defect</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>fault</em>
and <em>bug</em> are usually synonyms.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Real World</strong>: There is a long list of software
failures with serious consequences both in financial terms and in terms
of human lives. One of the most famous examples is the explosion of the
French rocket Ariane 5, when launched in 1996, from Kourou in French
Guiana. About 30 seconds after launch, the rocket exploded due to an
unexpected behavior of one of the onboard systems, causing a financial
loss of about half a billion dollars. Interestingly, the defect that
caused the failure in Ariane 5‚Äôs onboard system was very specific,
relatively simple, and limited to a few lines of code, implemented in
the ADA programming language, which is widely used in the development of
military and space software. The buggy lines were responsible for
converting a 64-bit floating-point value to a 16-bit integer. During the
tests and, probably, during previous rocket launches, the conversion was
always successful: the real number always <q>fit</q> into an integer.
However, on the date of the explosion, a condition that was never tested
before required the conversion of a real larger than the largest integer
that fits in 16 bits. Hence, a spurious result was generated, causing
the rocket‚Äôs control system to function erratically and leading to the
explosion.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.5" id="software-maintenance-and-evolution"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Software Maintenance and
Evolution <a href="#software-maintenance-and-evolution"
class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Just like traditional engineering systems, software also needs
maintenance. In this book, we will use the following classification for
the types of maintenance that can be carried out on software systems:
<strong>corrective</strong>, <strong>preventive</strong>,
<strong>adaptive</strong>, <strong>refactoring</strong>, and
<strong>evolutionary</strong>.</p>
<p> Corrective maintenance aims to correct bugs reported by users or
other developers.</p>
<p> On the other hand, preventive maintenance aims to correct latent
bugs in the code that have not yet caused failures visible to the
system‚Äôs users.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Real World</strong>: The maintenance activities carried out
by several companies before the turn of the last millennium, from 1999
to 2000, are an example of preventive maintenance. At that time, many
software applications were using two digits to store the year of a date,
that is, dates were in the DD-MM-AA format. Thus, the companies were
afraid that in 2000 and subsequent years some operations with dates
would return incorrect values. For example, a subtraction 00 - 99 could
result to an unexpected result. For this reason, companies set up
special task groups to carry out maintenance on their systems and
convert all date values to the DD-MM-YYYY format. As these activities
were carried out before the turn of the millennium, they are an example
of preventive maintenance.</p>
<p> Adaptive maintenance aims to adapt a system to a change in its
environment, including technology, legislation, rules for integration
with other systems or requests from new customers. As examples of
adaptive maintenance, we can mention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The migration of a system from Python 2.7 to Python 3.0.</p></li>
<li><p>The customization of a system to meet the requirements of a new
client ‚Äî that is, before deploying a system in new a client it is common
to make changes to accommodate for specifics of their business.</p></li>
<li><p>The adaptation of a system to comply with changes in legislation
or other contextual changes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refactorings are changes made to code that preserve its external
behavior but improve its design and maintainability. Examples of
refactoring operations include renaming a method or variable (to a more
intuitive and easy-to-remember name), breaking a large method into
smaller methods (to facilitate understanding) or moving a method to a
more appropriate class.</p>
<p> Evolutionary Maintenance is performed to include new features in a
system or to introduce significant improvements in existing features.
Software Systems can be used for decades exactly because they undergo
evolutionary maintenance, which preserve their value to the customers.
For example, many banking systems were created in the 70s and 80s in
programming languages such as COBOL. However, they have undergone
various changes and improvements, including the implementation of
several new features.</p>
<p> <strong>Legacy Systems</strong> are old systems, based on languages,
operating systems, and databases that are technologically outdated. For
this reason, the maintenance of these systems is more costly and risky.
However, it is important to note that legacy does not mean irrelevant,
because often these systems perform critical operations for their
customers.</p>
<p><strong>In-Depth:</strong> In the literature, there are alternative
classifications for software maintenance types. One of them, proposed by
Lientz &amp; Swanson, in 1978 (<a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=601062">link</a>), classifies
maintenance into the following categories: (1) Corrective, exactly as we
defined before; (2) Perfective, refers to the addition of new
functionalities; in this book, we decided to call it evolutionary
maintenance; (3) Adaptive, refers to changes in the operational
environment of the software, such as supporting a new hardware or
operating system; therefore, it does not include, for example,
customizations demanded by new clients, as proposed in this book; (4)
Preventive, refers to changes aimed at increasing a system‚Äôs
maintainability; in this book, we opted for the more common term today,
which is refactoring.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.6" id="configuration-management"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Configuration Management <a
href="#configuration-management" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Currently, it is inconceivable to develop software without a version
control system, such as git. These systems store all the versions of
software, covering not just the source code, but also documentation,
manuals, web pages, and reports. They also allow you to restore a
particular version. For example, if you change the code and this changes
results in a critical bug, you can easily return to the previous
version, prior to the bug‚Äôs introduction.</p>
<p> However, configuration management is more than just using a system
like git. It includes defining a set of policies for managing the
versions of a system. For example, a development team can decide that
the releases of a library they are implementing will be identified in
the format <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>.<em>z</em>, where <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em> and <em>z</em> are integers. An increment in <em>z</em>
occurs when a new release is launched with only bug fixes (commonly
called a <em>patch</em>); an increment in <em>y</em> occurs when a
release with small features is launched (commonly called a
<em>minor</em> version); and finally, an increment in <em>x</em> occurs
when a release with relevant new features is launched (commonly, called
a <em>major</em> version). This scheme for identifying releases is known
as <strong>semantic versioning</strong>.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.2.7</span> Project Management <a
href="#project-management" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Software development requires the use of project management
practices and activities such as negotiating contracts with clients (for
defining deadlines, prices, schedules, etc.), human resource management
(including hiring, training, defining promotion policies, and
remuneration values), risk management, monitoring competition,
marketing, finance, among others. In a project, the term
<strong>stakeholder</strong> designates all parties that have interest
in it. That is, the stakeholders are those who affect or are affected by
the project, whether they are individuals or organizations. For example,
common stakeholders in software projects include its developers and its
users, but also, project managers, subcontracted companies, suppliers of
any nature, possibly some level of government, among others.</p>
<p> There is a well-known quote, also by Frederick Brooks, that captures
a peculiarity of software projects. According to Brooks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> This comment became so famous that it is known as <strong>Brooks‚Äô
Law</strong>. Basically, this effect happens because the new developers
need first to understand and comprehend the entire codebase, its
architecture and design, before they start to produce useful code. In
addition, larger teams increase the communication and coordination
efforts to make and explain decisions. For example, if a team has three
developers (d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>), there are
three communication channels (d<sub>1</sub>-d<sub>2</sub>,
d<sub>1</sub>-d<sub>3</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>-d<sub>3</sub>); if it
grows to four developers, the number of channels doubles to six
channels. If the team grows to 10 developers, there are now 45
communication channels. For this reason, modern software is typically
developed in small teams, with about a dozen engineers, if that.</p>
<p><strong>In-Depth:</strong> Brooks‚Äô Law was proposed in a classic book
on software project management called <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>,
whose first edition was published in 1975 (<a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=207583">link</a>). In the book,
Brooks reports the lessons he learned early in his career as a manager
responsible for IBM‚Äôs first operating systems. In 1995, a second edition
of the book was released to commemorate its 20th anniversary. This
edition includes a new chapter with the article <em>No Silver Bullet ‚Äî
Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering</em>, originally published
in 1987 (and which we have already commented in this chapter). In 1999,
Frederick Brooks won the Turing Award, considered the Nobel Prize of
Computer Science.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.2.8</span> Software Development
Processes <a href="#software-development-processes" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> A development process defines the activities and events that should
be followed to build and deliver software. An analogy can be made, for
example, with the construction of buildings, which takes place according
to certain activities, such as : foundation, masonry, roofing, plumbing
installations, electrical installations, painting, among others.</p>
<p>There are two main types of processes that are used in the
construction of software systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Waterfall processes</p></li>
<li><p>Agile processes</p></li>
</ul>
<p> Waterfall processes were the first to be proposed, way back in the
‚Äô70s, when software engineering was beginning to gain prominence. They
were inspired by the processes used in traditional engineering, which
are largely sequential, as illustrated in the building example before.
Waterfall processes were widely used until the 1990s and much of the
reason is due to a standardization issued by the US Department of
Defense in 1985. As a result, around that time, all software contracted
by the Department of Defense had to be built using Waterfall.</p>
<p>Waterfall processes ‚Äî also called <strong>plan-driven
processes</strong> ‚Äî propose that the construction of a system should
follow sequential stages, like a waterfall, in which the water flows
from one level to another. As illustrated in the next figure, these
stages are requirement specification, analysis (or high-level design),
detailed design, coding, and testing. At the end of this
<q>waterfall</q>, the system is released for production, that is, for
effective use by its users.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./figs/cap1/waterfall-en.svg" style="width:87.0%"
alt="Phases of a Waterfall process." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Phases of a Waterfall
process.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> However, around the late ‚Äô90s, Waterfall processes started to be
criticized due to the repeated delays and issues with the projects.
which were occurring frequently. The main problem is that Waterfall
assumes a complete requirement gathering phase, followed by a detailed
design phase, which followed by a complete implementation and testing
phase. Therefore, the system is validated with users only after
finishing these phases, which may occur years after the beginning. By
then, the world may have changed, as well as the needs of the customers,
who no longer need the system they demanded years before. So, gathered
in a Utah city, in the United States, in February 2001, a group of 17
software engineers proposed an alternative way to construct software,
called Agile, which is also the name of the manifesto they published at
that meeting (<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">link</a>). In
contrast to Waterfall processes, in Agile a system is built
incrementally and iteratively. Small increments of functionality are
produced at intervals of about one month (or less than that) and they
are immediately validated by the users. Once the software increment is
approved, the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Agile principles had a profound impact on the industry. Today, they
are followed by a wide variety of organizations that produce software,
from small companies to large tech companies. Various methods based on
these principles were also proposed, such as <strong>XP</strong>,
<strong>Scrum</strong>, and <strong>Kanban</strong>.</p>
<p>These agile methods also helped to spread various development
practices, such as <strong>automated testing</strong>,
<strong>test-driven development</strong> (i.e., writing the tests first,
before the actual code), and <strong>continuous integration</strong>.
Continuous integration recommends that developers integrate the code
they produce immediately. If possible, every day, for example. The goal
is to avoid integration conflicts, which occur when two developers
change the same lines of code in parallel. The first developer to
integrate their lines will be successful; while the second one will be
informed that the lines of code have been modified by the first
developer.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.9" id="software-models"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.9</span> Software Models <a
href="#software-models" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> A model provides a higher level representation of a system than its
source code. The goal is to allow developers to analyze essential
properties and characteristics of a system, in an easier and faster way,
without diving into the details of the code. Models can be created
before the code, for example, during the design phase. In this case,
they are used to support <strong>Forward Engineering</strong>. That is,
first you create a model to have a higher level understanding of a
system, before moving on to coding. On the other hand, models can also
be created to help understand an existing code base. In this case, they
are an instrument of <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p> Usually, software models use graphical notations. For example,
<strong>UML</strong> (<em>Unified Modeling Language</em>) is a notation
that defines more than a dozen graphical diagrams to model structural
and behavioral properties of a system. The next figure shows a UML
diagram ‚Äî called a Class Diagram ‚Äî for the code used in the section on
Software Design . In this diagram, the rectangular boxes represent
classes, including their attributes and methods. Arrows are used to
denote relationships between classes. There are editors for creating UML
diagrams, which can be used, for example, in a Forward Engineering
scenario.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2.10" id="software-quality"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.10</span> Software Quality <a
href="#software-quality" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Quality is a recurring goal when engineering products. For example,
automobile manufacturers, cell phone makers, computer companies,
construction always claims they have quality products. This fact is no
different when the product is software. According to a classification
proposed by Bertrand Meyer (<a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=261119">link</a>), software
quality can be evaluated in two dimensions: <strong>external
quality</strong> or <strong>internal quality</strong>.</p>
<p> External quality considers factors that can be assessed without
analyzing the code. Thus, external quality factors can be evaluated even
by end-users, who are not experts in Software Engineering. As an
example, we have the following external quality factors (or
attributes):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correctness: Does the software meet its specification? In normal
situations, does it work as expected?</p></li>
<li><p>Robustness: Does the software continue to work when exceptional
events occur? For example, after a communication or disk failure.
Indeed, a robust software must not crash when such events occur.
Instead, it should at least warn users on the reasons leading to the
abnormal behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency: Does the software make the best use of computational
resources?</p></li>
<li><p>Portability: Can this software be ported to other platforms and
operating systems? Does it have versions for the major operating
systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS? Or, assuming it is a mobile
app, does it have versions for Android and iOS?</p></li>
<li><p>Ease of Use: Does the software have a user-friendly interface,
clear error messages, support more than one language, etc? Can it be
used by people with a disability, such as visual or auditory
difficulty?</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Is the software compatible with the main data
formats in its area? For example, assuming the software is a
spreadsheet, does it import files in XLS and CSV formats?</p></li>
</ul>
<p> On the other hand, internal quality considers properties and
characteristics related to the implementation of a system. Therefore,
internal quality can only be assessed by experts in Software Engineering
and not by any user. Examples of internal quality factors (or
attributes) include: modularity, code readability, maintainability, and
testability.</p>
<p>To ensure software quality, various strategies can be used. First,
<strong>metrics</strong> can be used to monitor the development of a
software product, including source code metrics and process metrics. An
example of a code metric is the number of lines in a program, which can
be used to give an idea of its size. Process metrics include, for
example, the number of defects reported in production by end-users over
a certain period of time.</p>
<p> There are also practices that can be followed to ensure the
production of quality software. Modernly, for example, many
organizations use <strong>code reviews</strong>, that is, the code
implemented by a developer only goes into production after being
reviewed and inspected by another developer of the team. The goal is to
detect <em>bugs</em> in advance, before the system goes into production.
In addition, code reviews serve to ensure the internal quality of the
code, i.e., its maintainability, readability, modularity, among others.
It also disseminates good software engineering practices among the team
members.</p>
<p>The next figure shows an example of code review, referring to an
example we commented in the Software Testing section. when an
organization uses code reviews, this code will be reviewed by another
developer, called the reviewer, before being put into production. This
reviewer could notice the bug and tag the code with a question, before
approving it. Then, the developer responsible for the code could agree
that, in fact, there is a bug, fix the code, and resubmit it for review.
Finally, it would be approved by the reviewer. There are several tools
to support code review processes. In the example, we used the tool
provided by GitHub.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.2.11</span> Professional Practice <a
href="#professional-practice" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> As stated in Bjarne Stroustrup‚Äôs opening quote of this chapter,
<em>our civilization runs software</em>. This results in many
opportunities for professionals in this area, but also generates
responsibilities and concerns. Issues about the professional practice of
software engineering start to arise when defining the curricula of
undergraduate courses, which should foster a solid background in the
fundamental aspects of Computer Science, such as algorithms and data
structures. However, it is also important to have courses covering the
key aspects of the profession, including the most important concepts,
methods, and techniques.</p>
<p> Lastly, but very relevant, there are questions about the role and
<strong>ethical responsibility</strong> of software engineers,
particularly in a society where human relationships are increasingly
mediated by algorithms and software. In this sense, the scientific
societies in the area have codes to help Computing professionals ‚Äî not
necessarily just Software Engineers ‚Äî to practice their profession
ethically. As examples, we have the Code of Ethics of the ACM (<a
href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">link</a>) and the IEEE
Computer Society (<a
href="https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics">link</a>). The
latter has its focus on the practice of Software Engineering. For
example, it recommends that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis,
specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software
a beneficial and respected profession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Real World:</strong> Stack Overflow conducts an annual survey
with users of the platform. In 2018, this survey was answered by more
than 100,000 developers from the most varied countries. Among the
questions, a group referred to ethical issues (<a
href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#ethics">link</a>).
One of them asked if developers have an obligation to consider the
ethical implications of the code they produce. Almost 80% of the
respondents answered yes. Another question was the following: who is
ultimately responsible for code that contributes to unethical behavior?
In this case, 57.5% answered the company‚Äôs top management, while 23%
said that are the developer themselves. When asked if they would agree
to write code with ethical concerns, 58% answered that no, and 37% said
that it would depend on the code requirements.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.12" id="economic-aspects"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.12</span> Economic Aspects <a
href="#economic-aspects" class="anchor-link"
aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h3>
<p> Many economic issues intertwine with software development. For
example, a software startup must decide the monetization model it wants
to adopt, whether based on subscriptions or advertisements, for example.
Mobile app developers have to decide on the price they will charge for
their application, which, among other variables, requires knowledge
about the price of the competitors. For this reason, it is no surprise
that large software companies currently employ economists to assess the
economic aspects of their software products.</p>
<p>To discuss a concrete case, in economics there is a frequent concern
with the opportunity costs of a decision. That is, every decision has an
opportunity cost, which refers to the missed opportunities associated
with the solutions that were discarded. In other words, when decision Y
is discarded and decision X is made instead, the benefits of Y become
missed opportunities. For example, suppose that your company‚Äôs main
product has a list of bugs. Are there benefits in correcting such bugs?
Sure, this will make customers happier and they will not think to churn.
However, there is also an opportunity cost in this decision.
Specifically, instead of fixings the bugs, the company could invest in
new functionalities, which would help it to expand the customer base.
Which is better? To fix the bugs or to implement new functionalities? In
the end, this is an economic decision.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="classification-of-software-systems"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Classification of Software
Systems <a href="#classification-of-software-systems"
class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true">üîó</a></h2>
<p> Software is integral to almost all human activities and comes in
various sizes and types, fulfilling an array of functional and
non-functional requirements. As such, we should not fall into the trap
of thinking that there is only one way to develop software. It would be
incorrect to assume that all software must be implemented using the same
processes, design principles, or quality assurance mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bertrand Meyer proposed a classification (<a
href="https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/03/25/the-abc-of-software-engineering/">link</a>)
that aids in distinguishing and reasoning about the types of software
that can be developed and identifying suitable software engineering
practices for each. According to Meyer, there are three main types of
software: Systems A (Acute), Systems B (Business), and Systems C
(Casual). We will initially discuss Systems C and A, followed by Systems
B.</p>
<p> Type C systems, or casual systems, are not subject to high-quality
pressures. They can afford to have minor bugs without jeopardizing their
operation. Examples include a script for an academic project, a
one-time-use data migration program, or a system to manage a student
association‚Äôs membership. These systems do not necessarily require high
standards of internal quality, optimal runtime performance, or
sophisticated user interfaces. They are usually implemented by a small
team and are lightweight and non-critical. Therefore, they do not
benefit from the practices, techniques, and processes discussed in this
book. <strong>Over-engineering</strong> is a risk for such systems, as
there is no need for advanced techniques. In the context of Type C
systems, software engineering can resemble using a sledgehammer to crack
a nut.</p>
<p> On the opposite end are Type A systems, or acute systems, where a
single failure can lead to devastating consequences, including loss of
life. These include control systems like those in autonomous vehicles,
nuclear power plants, airplanes, ICU equipment, and subway trains. The
software that controlled the Ariane 5 rocket is an example. Developing
these systems demands rigorous processes, including comprehensive code
review and external certification. It is common to have redundancies in
hardware and software alike‚Äîfor instance, two parallel-running systems
that only make a decision if both agree. Sometimes these systems are
designed with a formal language, founded on logic or set theory.</p>
<p><strong>Alert:</strong> We will not focus on Type A systems A, or
mission-critical systems, in this book.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at Type B systems B, or business systems, which
benefit most from the principles and practices discussed in this book.
These systems encompass a broad range of corporate applications (like
finance, HR, logistics, sales), various types of web-based systems,
software libraries and frameworks, general-purpose applications (such as
text editors, spreadsheets), and basic software systems (like compilers,
IDEs). The concepts discussed in this book will make the development of
Type B systems more productive and contribute to better quality
software, both internally (more easy to maintain systems) and externally
(systems with less production bugs).</p>
